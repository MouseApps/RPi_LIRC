# RPi_LIRC
Light switch controller using Raspberry Pi

This project focuses on providing simple instructions and code on turning your Raspberry Pi into a light switch controller. Much of this project has been developed from resources found on the Internet but we hope to make it even easier for folks by providing all instructions in plain non-techie language so anyone can get up to speed with these instructions. Each section will have an TL:DR for those who want to get up and running ASAP. <b> Disclaimer: By continuing reading, following, pulling, or utilizing any aspects of the content provided in this Git you hold MouseApps and their developers harmless of any damage realized as a result from this guide</b>
