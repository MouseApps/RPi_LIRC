# RPi_LIRC

Light switch controller using Raspberry Pi

This project focuses on providing simple instructions and code on turning your Raspberry Pi into a light switch controller. Much of this project has been developed from resources found on the Internet but we hope to make it even easier for folks by providing all instructions in plain non-techie language so anyone can get up to speed with these instructions. Each section will have an TL:DR for those who want to get up and running ASAP. <b> Disclaimer: By continuing reading, following, pulling, or utilizing any aspects of the content provided in this Git you hold MouseApps and their developers harmless of any damage realized as a result from this guide</b>

<h2>Audience</h2>
Those who want to turn a Raspberry Pi into a controller for your light switch. Reasonable knowledge of technology and common computing terms.

<h2>Let's get started with a mac!</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Obtain Hardware</h3>
We have tested this guide with the following hardware:

Stuff You'll Need:

* Raspberry Pi2 B [(Link to Amazon - let us know if this works on a Pi3 and we'll update the link)] (<https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Desktop-Linux/dp/B00T2U7R7I/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499172596&sr=1-3&keywords=pi+>)
* IR Board [(here is the on we used)](https://www.amazon.com/Infrared-Shield-RPi/dp/B01C2AQL62/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499172489&sr=1-1&keywords=pi+ir>)
* Power cable
* Mouse (just to install OS and turn on SSH)
* MicroSD card with latest version of Raspian
* Diet Coke, Coffee, Beer, or other favorite tinkering beverage
* 30 minutes to 1 hour


todo: clean install of raspian with head
go headless with ssh
unplug and place in room with internet connection and plug into ir module 
apt-get dist-upgrade
apt-get update

aptget intsall lirc
aptet (lamp stack)
